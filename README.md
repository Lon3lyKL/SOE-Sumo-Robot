## 📖 Project Concept
This project combines the excitement of **traditional sumo bots** with the competitive elements of **battle bots**, creating a simple, fun, and entertaining outreach game.  
Designed for the NP School of Engineering (SOE) MR course, these robots are used to engage students and showcase robotics in an interactive way.

## ⚙️ How It Works
- **Power**: Each robot is powered by a **12V 50A lithium-ion battery**.  
- **Control System**:  
  - **ESP32 (38-pin)** as the main microcontroller.  
  - **GPIO ESP32 DevKit + MotorShield (Khurs Labs design)** for extended connectivity and for motor, servo, and LED control..  
- **Inputs**: Robots are operated via a **Bluetooth controller** and physical **button inputs**.

## 🎮 Game Objective
Two robots face off in the playfield with **two possible win conditions**:
1. **Push the opponent out** of the playfield.  
2. **Disable the opponent’s robot** by pressing its button **three times**.
